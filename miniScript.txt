Hagrid:  You’re a wizard, Harry.

Harry Potter:  Hagrid, I don’t think you can be right.

Hermione: I’m not even    in this part of the book

Ron Weasley: Hey, neither am I!

Harry Potter: Who are you people?

Hermione: We are your future friends! I know because I’m actually a secret seer. It's actually quite common.  I'm descended from the great prophetess of Delphi, and I'm of the bloodline of Apollo.

Ron Weasley: No you’re not.

Hagrid: Tha’s enough.

Hermione: How do you know?

Ron Weasley: I just know, that’s how

Hagrid: I said, that’s enough.
